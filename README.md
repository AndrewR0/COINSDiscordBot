# MerchantDiscordBot

This bot is a personal project that allows admins to add items to a store and members to buy those items with currency provided by the bot/admins.

So far, I have yet to test whether the bot stores items/members in server specific databases and have yet to finish the commands for members.

In the near future, I plan to make the bot's messages into embeds.

NOTE: The bot does not have a dedicated wed/cloud server, at the moment, so it therefore does not run 24/7.
